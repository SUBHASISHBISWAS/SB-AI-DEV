2. Little bit of experience dealing with Data



Introduction to AI
===================

Goal: Extract Intelligence !!

1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Data Mining


					Artificial Intelligence 
	          (Business Term: Simulate human intelligence (machine, software))
						|
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
		|								    |
	Traditional Programming					      Automated Learning
	(Manual Programming)					(You want machine to understand the logic,
	C++, C, Java						pattern)
	(How to write the logic)				(Logic is discovered from HISTORICAL data)
	(How to reach the solution)						    |
					---------------------------------------------------------
					|						        |
				Machine Learning					Deep Learning
			The outcome of ML is a STATIC model		The outcome of DL is a Neural Network
												(Dynamic Model)


Model ---> Like Brain who can think of a solution for a given problem !!!

	2 ----> Model (+) ----> 4 
	2 ---->
	
	(Output based on his 
	Experiece)
	(Feeding Historical Data
	during learning phase)


Bigdata
=========

Bigdata is a TERM. Its not a TECHNOLOGY. ITS not a TOOL. 

Its all about the abililty of the SOFTWARE/ FRAMEWORK / HARDWARE/ ARCHITECTURE to HANDLE the data.

HANDLE refers to :
	a. LOAD
	b. PROCESS
	c. STORE

If in any of the above scenario, the SOFTWARE/ FRAMEWORK / HARDWARE/ ARCHITECTURE crashes, I can say we are facing a BIGDATA problem.

e.g. 201201hourly.txt

Notepad  ---> It tried but failed to LOAD the data, Thus for NOTEPAD, its a BIGDATA !!!

Wordpad ----> It tried, had some LATENCY, but loaded the data SUCCESSFULLY. Thus for Wordpad, its a NORMAL DATA !!!




Basic Knowledge on Python
===========================

Basic Concepts
- Python Basics
- Collection Objects (List, Tuples, Dictionary, Set)
- Conditional Statements (if else, if, elif ladder)
- Functions and Lambda Expressions


Data Wrangling, EDA, Data Manipulation
2. Numpy Package
3. Pandas Package 

ML and Data mining Implementations
4. Sci-kit learn

For Visualization
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
