Handling inappropriate data
==============================

The only thing that will help you to deal with inappropriate data is having enough DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE !!!

Guidelines by Prashant Nair:
--------------------------------
1. Identify the type of data for each column. *(Numerical, categorical and ordinal)

2. Check and remove all duplicate records and columns from the DATAFRAME

3. For numerical columns, identify whether the data is continous or discrete.

   If your data is continous, check with reference to the domain if the following is allowed or not,
		1. Negative Numbers
		2. Positive Numbers
		3. Decimals allowed or just Integers are expected.
  
   If your data is discrete, check the following with reference to the domain,
		1. Range of the number allowed (e.g. for Marks column(max 100) (0 - 100) )
		2. Decimals allowed or just integer expected

4. For categorical columns, perform the following,
	1. Get the unique values of the column
	2. Handle the data which has spelling errors, case errors (lowercase, uppercase etc)
	3. Check whether the groups shown in the unique values match the domain specification.

5. For ordinal columns, perform the following,
	1. Get the unique values of the column
	2. Handle the data which has spelling errors, case errors (lowercase, uppercase etc) 
	3. Check whether the groups shown in the unique values match the domain specification.
	4. Check the mathematical weightage of  each unique group. Ensure it match the domain specification. 
	5. If no mathematical weightage present at column, ensure you build the same.

		e.g Ratings		Ratings
		    --------   -->      ---------
		     5 star		  5
		     2 star		  2	
		     3 star		  3

6. Dealing with date columns [Date has significance only when you are dealing with Time Series Analysis]
	1. Convert the date column into datetime datatype
	2. Ensure the row index for the dataframe is date column
	3. Incase of missing values on date column, ideally it is recommended to delete the record or take mode only            if domain specification supports the same.



Rules to handle Missing Data
==============================

The below steps are helpful if you dont consider DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE!!!

Statistical Rules:
-------------------
1. If your column is Numeric(Continous) , replace NaN with Mean | replace with Default Values
2. If your column is Numeric(Discrete), replace NaN with Median | replace with Default Values
3. If your column is Categorical, replace NaN with Mode (Most Frequent) | replace with Default Values
4. If your column is Ordinal, replace NaN with Mode | replace with Default Values
