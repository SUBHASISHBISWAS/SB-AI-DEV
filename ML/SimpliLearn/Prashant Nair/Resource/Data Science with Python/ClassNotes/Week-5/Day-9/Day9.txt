===================

Types of tests that you can perform:

				Hypothesis Testing

Use-case: 50_Startups.csv
Features: R&DSpend: Numerical Data
	  Administration: NUmerical Data
          Marketing: Numerical Data
          State: Categorical

Label: Profit: Numerical Data

Algo: Regression Based Algorithms
	a. Linear Regression (Simple, Multiple, Polynomial) 
		- There must exists linear relationship(positive,negative) between features and label
		- The data must a normalized data (Bell curve) (Guassian Distribution)

	b. Support Vector Regression
		- There must exists linear relationship(positive,negative) between features and label
		- You can give be Gaussian distribution or any distribution

	c. Decision Tree Regression
		- There must exists linear relationship(positive,negative) between features and label
	d. Random Forest Regression
		- There must exists linear relationship(positive,negative) between features and label
	e. XGBoost
		- There must exists linear relationship(positive,negative) between features and label

Correlation Test for Hypothesis Testing
========================================

				Correlation Test
					|
			-----------------------------------------
			|				        |
	Linear Relationship 				Monotonic Relationship
	1. Pearson's Correlation Coeff Test		1. Spearman's Rank Test
		(Feature and Label			2. Kendall's Rank Test
		must be NUMERIC)			  (Feature and Label
							    must be NUMERIC)

Test for Categorical Variable
===============================
If any one variable is categorical, go for CHI Square test

Rules of Chi-square:

1. Feature: Numerical , Label: Categorical
2. Feature: Categorical ,  Label: Numerical
3. Feature: Categorical , Label: Categorical

Chi-square Test - Whether the variables are related or independent.

Question: Is there any relationship between State and Profit?

Null Hypothesis(H0): State and Profit are independent of each other.
Alternate Hypothesis (H1): State and Profit have some form of relationship.

Test used: Chi-square

Steps to perform Chi-square:
	1. Create Contigency Table which holds data in numeric representation
	2. Apply chi-square on contigency Table
	3. Check your Hypothesis









Normality Test: To check whether my column follows normal distribution or not (Guassian Dist). There may be some algorithms which will require your data to be normalized. For that algo we do this test.

	e.g. Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes


Lets assume R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend is selected as features for my LinearRegression. Now lets check whether each column are following Guassian Distribution or not.

Null Hypothesis (H0) : R&D Spend is not Normal Distribution
Alternate Hypothesis (H1): R&D Spend is Normally distributed

Test:
1. Shapiro-Wilk Test
2. Anderson-Darling Test


Parametric and Non-parametric Test:

Use of This test: This test is used to identify whether the given columns are same or different(Statistical Weightage). 
Official Statistics Definition: To check whether the columns are significantly different

Null Hypothesis (H0) --> Columns are equal
Alternate Hypothesis (H1) --> Columns are unequal(different)


Parametric Test:

If you have only 2 columns to test:
	1. Student t-test
	2. Paired Student t-test

If you have more than 2 columns to test:
	1.  ANOVA (Analysis of Variance Test)


Non-parametric Test:

If you have only 2 columns to test:
	1. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
	2. Mann-Whitney U test

If you have more than 2 columns to test:
	1. Kruskal-Wallis H-test
	2. Friedman Test







NLP --- Natural Language Processing
====================================

				Non-Numeric Features
					|
		---------------------------------------------------------
		|			|				|
	Categorical			Ordinal			Pure Text Data
	(LabelEncoder			(Replace values		(Use NLP to convert the data into numeric weights)
	 OneHotEncoder)		with relevant numeric values)
	(getDummies)


NLP ---> Natural Language Processing ----> English

Rules:
1. There exists no punctuations
2. There exists no stopwords (Stopwords are those words which has no grammar impact on the data.)
3. Sentences must be converted to words to form BagOfWords

	BagofWords -----> TF-IDF(Term Frequency     ---------> frequency weights of each word
				Inverse Doc Frequency)

Using the freq weights the machine can identify the words and its nature

Package: sklearn ( CountVectorizer, TDIDFTransformer )
