Handling inappropriate data
==============================

The only thing that will help you to deal with inappropriate data is having enough DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE !!!

Guidelines by Prashant Nair:
--------------------------------
1. Identify the type of data for each column. *(Numerical, categorical and ordinal)

2. Check and remove all duplicate records and columns from the DATAFRAME

3. For numerical columns, identify whether the data is continous or discrete.

   If your data is continous, check with reference to the domain if the following is allowed or not,
		1. Negative Numbers
		2. Positive Numbers
		3. Decimals allowed or just Integers are expected.
  
   If your data is discrete, check the following with reference to the domain,
		1. Range of the number allowed (e.g. for Marks column(max 100) (0 - 100) )
		2. Decimals allowed or just integer expected

4. For categorical columns, perform the following,
	1. Get the unique values of the column
	2. Handle the data which has spelling errors, case errors (lowercase, uppercase etc)
	3. Check whether the groups shown in the unique values match the domain specification.

5. For ordinal columns, perform the following,
	1. Get the unique values of the column
	2. Handle the data which has spelling errors, case errors (lowercase, uppercase etc) 
	3. Check whether the groups shown in the unique values match the domain specification.
	4. Check the mathematical weightage of  each unique group. Ensure it match the domain specification. 
	5. If no mathematical weightage present at column, ensure you build the same.

		e.g Ratings		Ratings
		    --------   -->      ---------
		     5 star		  5
		     2 star		  2	
		     3 star		  3

6. Dealing with date columns [Date has significance only when you are dealing with Time Series Analysis]
	1. Convert the date column into datetime datatype
	2. Ensure the row index for the dataframe is date column
	3. Incase of missing values on date column, ideally it is recommended to delete the record or take mode only            if domain specification supports the same.



What are Outliers
==================
Outliers are extreme values that affect the model performance and accuracy.

40000000000 --- Outlier

Question: How to handle Outlier / treat Outliers?
1. Use Domain Knowledge
2. Use IQR (Inter Quartile Range) --- Statistical Method


Stages of Data Handling 
========================

1. Raw Data ---> 
2. Handle Inappropriate Data ---> 
3. Handling Missing Data ---> 
4. Handling Categorical Data --> 
5. Handling Ordinal data ----> 
6. Perform Outlier Detection and Elimination ----> 
7. Feature Scaling ---> 
8. Train/Test Split --> 
9. Model ---> 
10.Accuracy/Generalization Check ---> 
11.Feature Engineering (if Reqd)---> 
12.Final Model ---> 
13.Deploy




Unsupervised Learning
========================

You will have features . Your job is to find,
1. Hidden patterns (Time Series and Dimensionality Reduction)
2. Hidden Clusters (Clustering Techniques - e.g. KMeans)
3. Forecasting based on patterns (Time Series)

Clustering using KMeans
------------------------

Creating Groups based on distance formula
K-Means

You need to assume K value where K is no of clusters/groups. To guess the number of groups you can try the following:
1. Perform EDA to check if dataset can form cluster
2. Use k-means++ inertia (Elbow Method)
