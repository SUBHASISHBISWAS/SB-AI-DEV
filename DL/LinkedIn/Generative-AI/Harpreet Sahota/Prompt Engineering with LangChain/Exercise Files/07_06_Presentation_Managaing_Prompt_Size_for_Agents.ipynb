Biography Youth and education House of birth in Brunswick (destroyed in World War II) Caricature of Abraham Gotthelf Kästner by Gauss (1795) Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), to a family of lower social status. His father Gebhard Dietrich Gauss (1744-1808) worked in ... In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings.String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other ... Noether's theorem states that every continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system with conservative forces has a corresponding conservation law. This is the first of two theorems (see Noether's second theorem) proven by mathematician Emmy Noether in 1915 and published in 1918. [1] The support required by school teachers and the whole school is beyond the delivery of a time-limited MBP. For example, Hwang et al. formed a learning circle of making connections with the self and colleagues in supportive mindfulness practice, following an MBP for teachers.

The spaces of multivariate functions that can be implemented by a network are determined by the structure of the network, the set of simple functions, and its multiplicative parameters.  A great deal of theoretical work has gone into characterizing these function spaces.\n","In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks, universal approximation theorems are results that put limits on what neural networks can theoretically learn.  Specifically, given an algorithm that generates the networks within a class of functions, the theorems establish the density of the generated functions within a given function space of interest.  Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology. What must be stressed, is that while some functions can be arbitrarily well approximated in a region, the proofs do not apply outside of the region, i.e. the approximated functions do not extrapolate outside of the region. That applies for all non-periodic activation functions, i.e. what's in practice used and most proofs assume.\n","However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, radial basis functions, or neural networks with specific properties. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary width\" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary depth\" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer (\"bounded depth and bounded width\" case).\n","Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions with appropriate weights. On the other hand, they typically do not provide a construction for the weights, but merely state that such a construction is possible. To construct the weight, neural networks are trained, and they may converge on the correct weights, or not (i.e. get stuck in a local optimum). If the network is too small (for the dimensions of input data) then the universal approximation theorems do not apply, i.e. the networks will not learn. What was once proven about the depth of a network, i.e. a single hidden layer enough, only applies for one dimension, in general such a network is too shallow. The width of a network is also an important hyperparameter. The choice of an activation function is also important, and some work, and proofs written about, assume e.g. ReLU (or sigmoid) used, while some, such as a linear are known to not work (nor any polynominal).\n","Neural networks with an unbounded (non-polynomial) activation function have the universal approximation property.The universal approximation property of width-bounded networks has been studied as a dual of classical universal approximation results on depth-bounded networks. For input dimension dx and output dimension dy  the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the Lp functions is exactly max{dx + 1, dy} (for a ReLU network).  More generally this also holds if both ReLU and a threshold activation function are used.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Perceptron\n","Summary: In machine learning, the perceptron (or McCulloch–Pitts neuron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.  It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Physics-informed neural networks\n","Summary: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). They overcome the low data availability of some biological and engineering systems that makes most state-of-the-art machine learning techniques lack robustness, rendering them ineffective in these scenarios. The prior knowledge of general physical laws acts in the training of neural networks (NNs) as a regularization agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the correctness of the function approximation. This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution and to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples.\n","\n","Page: Deep learning\n","Summary: Deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with representation learning.

RL considers the problem of a computational agent learning to make decisions by trial and error. Deep RL incorporates deep learning into the solution, allowing agents to make decisions from unstructured input data without manual engineering of the state space. Deep RL algorithms are able to take in very large inputs (e.g. every pixel rendered to the screen in a video game) and decide what actions to perform to optimize an objective (e.g. maximizing the game score).

At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.

The goal of these technologies is to allow the majority of the graphics pipeline to run at a lower resolution for increased performance, and then infer a higher resolution image from this that approximates the same level of detail as if the image had been rendered at this higher resolution. This allows for higher graphical settings and/or frame rates for a given output resolution, depending on user preference.As of September 2022, the 1st and 2nd generation of DLSS is available on all RTX branded cards from Nvidia in supported titles, while the 3rd generation unveiled at Nvidia's GTC 2022 event is exclusive to Ada Lovelace generation RTX 40 series graphics cards.

They are often manycore designs and generally focus on low-precision arithmetic, novel dataflow architectures or in-memory computing capability. As of 2024, a typical AI integrated circuit chip contains tens of billions of MOSFET transistors.AI accelerators are used in mobile devices, such as neural processing units (NPUs) in Apple iPhones or Huawei cellphones, and personal computers such as Apple silicon Macs, to cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform.

Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\n","The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods.

Deeper learning is based on the premise that the nature of work, civic, and everyday life is changing and therefore increasingly requires that formal education provides young people with mastery of skills like analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.\n","Deeper learning is associated with a growing movement in U.S. education that places special emphasis on the ability to apply knowledge to real-world circumstances and to solve novel problems.A number of U.S. schools and school districts serving a broad socio-economic spectrum apply deeper learning as an integral component of their instructional approach.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n","Invoking: `wikipedia` with `Universal approximation theorem`\n","\n","\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Universal approximation theorem\n","Summary: Artificial neural networks are combinations of multiple simple mathematical functions that implement more complicated functions from (typically) real-valued vectors to real-valued vectors.  The spaces of multivariate functions that can be implemented by a network are determined by the structure of the network, the set of simple functions, and its multiplicative parameters.  A great deal of theoretical work has gone into characterizing these function spaces.\n","In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks, universal approximation theorems are results that put limits on what neural networks can theoretically learn.  Specifically, given an algorithm that generates the networks within a class of functions, the theorems establish the density of the generated functions within a given function space of interest.  Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology. What must be stressed, is that while some functions can be arbitrarily well approximated in a region, the proofs do not apply outside of the region, i.e. the approximated functions do not extrapolate outside of the region. That applies for all non-periodic activation functions, i.e. what's in practice used and most proofs assume.\n","However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, radial basis functions, or neural networks with specific properties. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary width\" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (\"arbitrary depth\" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer (\"bounded depth and bounded width\" case).\n","Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions with appropriate weights. On the other hand, they typically do not provide a construction for the weights, but merely state that such a construction is possible. To construct the weight, neural networks are trained, and they may converge on the correct weights, or not (i.e. get stuck in a local optimum). If the network is too small (for the dimensions of input data) then the universal approximation theorems do not apply, i.e. the networks will not learn. What was once proven about the depth of a network, i.e. a single hidden layer enough, only applies for one dimension, in general such a network is too shallow. The width of a network is also an important hyperparameter. The choice of an activation function is also important, and some work, and proofs written about, assume e.g. ReLU (or sigmoid) used, while some, such as a linear are known to not work (nor any polynominal).\n","Neural networks with an unbounded (non-polynomial) activation function have the universal approximation property.The universal approximation property of width-bounded networks has been studied as a dual of classical universal approximation results on depth-bounded networks. For input dimension dx and output dimension dy  the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the Lp functions is exactly max{dx + 1, dy} (for a ReLU network).  More generally this also holds if both ReLU and a threshold activation function are used.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Perceptron\n","Summary: In machine learning, the perceptron (or McCulloch–Pitts neuron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.  It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Physics-informed neural networks\n","Summary: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). They overcome the low data availability of some biological and engineering systems that makes most state-of-the-art machine learning techniques lack robustness, rendering them ineffective in these scenarios. The prior knowledge of general physical laws acts in the training of neural networks (NNs) as a regularization agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the correctness of the function approximation. This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution and to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples.\n","\n","Page: Deep learning\n","Summary: Deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with representation learning.

By combining gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools, PANTHER enables biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data obtained from the current advance technology including: sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments.\n","Shortly, using the data and tools on the PANTHER, users will be able to:\n","Obtain information about a particular gene of interest.\n","Discover protein families and subfamilies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components.\n","Create lists of genes related to a particular protein family/subfamily, molecular function, biological process or pathway.\n","Analyze lists of genes, proteins or transcripts.\n","\n","Page: Generation\n","Summary: A generation refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively. It can also be described as, \"the average period, generally considered to be about 20–⁠30 years, during which children are born and grow up, become adults, and begin to have children.\" In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. It is known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in the biological sciences.\n","Generation is also often used synonymously with birth/age cohort in demographics, marketing, and social science; under this formulation it means \"people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time.\" Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as \"social generations\", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education.\n","\n","Page: Procedural generation\n","Summary: In computing, procedural generation (sometimes shortened as proc-gen) is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated content and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3D models. In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay. Procedural generation is a branch of media synthesis.\n","\n","Page: Metadata\n","Summary: Metadata (or metainformation) is \"data that provides information about other data\", but not the content of the data itself, such as the text of a message or the image itself. There are many distinct types of metadata, including:\n","\n","Descriptive metadata – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.\n","Structural metadata – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.\n","Administrative metadata – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.\n","Reference metadata – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.\n","Statistical metadata – also called process data, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.\n","Legal metadata – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.Metadata is not strictly bound to one of these categories, as it can describe a piece of data in many other ways.\n","\n","Page: Lead generation\n","Summary: In marketing, lead generation () is the initiation of consumer interest or inquiry into the products or services of a business. A lead is the contact information and, in some cases, demographic information of a customer who is interested in a specific product or service.\n","Leads may come from various sources or activities, for example, digitally via the Internet, through personal referrals, through telephone calls either by the company or telemarketers, through advertisements, and events.\n","\n","In 2014, a study found that direct traffic, search engines, and web referrals were the three most popular online channels for lead generation, accounting for 93% of leads.\n","In 2018, Chief Marketer found that B2B marketers favored email, live events, and content marketing as their top three.\n","After the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Gartner identified increases in social and search engine optimization for B2B marketers, while B2C marketers favored digital advertising.Lead generation is often paired with lead management to move leads through the purchase funnel. This combination of activities is referred to as pipeline marketing, which is often broken into a marketing and a sales pipeline.\n","\n","Page: Statistical inference\n","Summary: Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.\n","Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In machine learning, the term inference is sometimes used instead to mean \"make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model\"; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as training or learning (rather than inference), and using a model for prediction is referred to as inference (instead of prediction); see also predictive inference.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mDeep learning works due to a combination of factors related to the model's architecture and the data it is trained on.
