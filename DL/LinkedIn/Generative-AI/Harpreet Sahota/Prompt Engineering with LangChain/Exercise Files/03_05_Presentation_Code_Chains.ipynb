It is not merely an intellectual enterprise but a way of life, emphasizing ethics as the main focus of human knowledge. Stoicism outlines a path to personal happiness and wisdom, which is achieved through understanding the workings of the universe and our place within it. \n","\n","At the heart of Stoic philosophy for a good life are several key principles:\n","\n","1. **Understanding What is in Our Control**: The Stoics distinguish between what is in our control and what is not. According to Epictetus, one of the most prominent Stoic philosophers, things in our control include our own opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. Everything else, including our bodies, possessions, and reputations, is not truly ours and not in our control. Recognizing this distinction helps individuals focus on their own actions and attitudes, leading to inner peace and resilience.\n","\n","2. **Living According to Nature**: Stoics believe that living in agreement with nature means understanding the rational structure of the universe and living in accordance with it. This entails recognizing our nature as rational beings and living a life of virtue, which is the sole good in Stoic philosophy. Virtue consists of wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation.\n","\n","3. **The Four Cardinal Virtues**: Stoicism holds that a good life is achieved through the practice of the four cardinal virtues. Wisdom or prudence is the knowledge of what we should do, what we should not do, and what is neither. Courage is not merely physical bravery but the strength to face any situation, particularly adversity, with confidence and valour. Justice involves dealing fairly and equitably with others, acting with integrity, and performing one's roles in society well. Temperance or moderation is the self-control and discipline over one's desires and impulses.\n","\n","4. **Emotional Resilience through Rationality**: Stoics aim for apatheia, a state of tranquillity arising from the absence of irrational or harmful emotions. This doesn't mean the absence of all feelings, but rather freedom from the negative emotions that arise from poor judgments and attachments to things beyond our control. By using reason, we can reassess our impressions of events, recognizing that external events in themselves do not cause distress, but our judgments about them do.\n","\n","5. **The Dichotomy of Control**: A core Stoic practice is to continually remind oneself of the difference between what is within our control and what is not. This awareness encourages a focus on our own actions and responses, leading to a reduction in suffering and frustration with external circumstances.\n","\n","6. **Cosmopolitanism**: The Stoics were early proponents of cosmopolitanism—the idea that all human beings, regardless of their social, racial, or political divisions, belong to a single community. They advocated for understanding and compassion towards all people, emphasizing that we should live not just for ourselves, but for the wellbeing of the global community.\n","\n","7. **Acceptance and Amor Fati**: Stoicism teaches acceptance of everything that happens, seeing it as part of a rational order in the universe. Amor fati, the love of fate, is a Stoic principle that encourages us to embrace whatever life throws at us, not merely to bear it as a necessary evil but to love it and see it as something that was meant for us.\n","\n","Living a good life, according to Stoicism, is thus about cultivating virtue, exercising rational judgment, and maintaining emotional equilibrium through the ups and downs of life. It’s about recognizing what truly matters, focusing on our own character and actions, and embracing our place within the broader community and the natural world."]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 🧬 Sequential Chains\n","\n","**Basics of Sequential Chains:**\n","\n","- Sequential chains are for when you need one language model's output to become another's input.\n","- They're like an assembly line, where each step's result is the starting point for the next.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bzfm_z1c4pTT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n","from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser\n","\n","# Initialize the language model\n","llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4-0125-preview\")\n","\n","# Template for the initial rap\n","template_one = \"\"\"\n","You are a Punjabi Jatt rapper, like AP Dhillon or Sidhu Moosewala.\n","\n","Given a topic, it is your job to spit bars of hard-hitting, gritty, dope rap.\n","\n","Topic: {topic}\n","\n","Rap:\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Template for the diss track\n","template_two = \"\"\"\n","You are an extremely competitive Punjabi Rapper.\n","\n","Given the rap from another rapper, it's your job to write a diss track which\n","tears apart the rap and shames the original rapper.\n","\n","Rap:\n","{rap}\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Create prompt templates from the defined templates\n","prompt_template_one = PromptTemplate.from_template(template_one)\n","prompt_template_two = PromptTemplate.from_template(template_two)\n","\n","# Define the operation chain\n","chain = (\n","    {\"rap\": prompt_template_one | llm | StrOutputParser()}\n","    | prompt_template_two\n","    | llm\n","    | StrOutputParser()\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"t6eQg6SZVb2G","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706245244286,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":499,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet Sahota","userId":"04881662502078178826"}}},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"Drinking Crown Royal and mobbin in my red Challenger\"})"],"metadata":{"id":"dewp-fH2W4jp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for chunk in chain.stream({\"topic\": \"Drinking Crown Royal and mobbin in my red Challenger\"}):\n","    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"ADgrDDqkW4uD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706245315289,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":37357,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet Sahota","userId":"04881662502078178826"}},"outputId":"ddf2ce79-9d0c-472b-c381-0f3740a50999"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Aye, hold up, let me break it down, real quick,\n","\n","Rollin' through these verses, found nothing but a gimmick,\n","Talkin' 'bout your Challenger, but bro, where's the spirit?\n","Sip that Crown Royal, but it don't improve your lyric,\n","Punjabi Rapper on the throne?

It underscores the significance of self-reliance for happiness and advises against being distracted by external events or seeking validation from others. The text also highlights the importance of having a purpose and not wandering aimlessly through life. It suggests that sins committed through lust are worse than those committed through anger, as they reveal a lack of self-control.

Yo, focus on being real as a Roman, as a dude, doing your thing with deep seriousness, love, freedom, and fairness. Forget all that other noise in your head about easing your mind. You got this if you treat every move like it's your last, cutting out all the fake stuff, all emotional and stubborn deviations from reason, and all that faking and self-love. You gotta let go of hating what fate or the big man upstairs throws at you. There ain't much required to keep on a winning streak and live that godly life, 'cause the gods ain't asking for more than just sticking to these rules.\\n\\nIII. Do your thing, soul, trash and disrespect yourself; but remember, time's running out for self-respect. Your happiness is on you, but here you are, life slipping away, playing yourself, thinking your joy comes from what others think.\\n\\nIV. Why let the outside stuff mess with you so bad? Take a minute to learn something solid and stop wandering around aimlessly. Watch out for that other kind of wandering, too, where people bust their backs in life without any real goal or desire guiding them. Remember, hardly anyone gets unhappy by minding their own business and not sweating what's in another person's soul. Those who don't steer their soul with reason are bound to be miserable.\\n\\nVI. Keep these in your mind: What's the universe about, and what's your role in it? How do you fit into the grand scheme, and remember, nobody can stop you from acting and speaking in harmony with your true nature.\\n\\nVII. Theophrastus, like a true philosopher, said that sins done in lust are worse than those done in anger. Anger might show someone turning away from reason out of pain, but giving into pleasure shows a weaker, less manly vibe. So, he argues, falling for pleasure is worse than reacting in anger, 'cause at least the angry dude was provoked first.\\n\\nVIII. Whatever you're into, whatever your plans, roll with them like you might peace out any second. And about death, if there are gods, they won't do you dirty. If there aren't, or they don't care, why stick around in a godless scene? But hey, there are gods, and they do look out for us. They've given us the power to dodge the truly nasty stuff, like vice. If there was anything else really bad, they'd help us avoid that too. So why sweat what doesn't change who you are? The universe ain't messed up enough to let the good and bad happen without reason. As for life, death, props, dissing, work, fun, riches, broke times, they hit everyone the same, but they don't define us.\\n\\nIX. Think about how quickly everything breaks down and goes back to the earth, and memories fade into time. Reflect on the nature of all the flashy, tempting, or annoying stuff out there – how empty, fleeting, and lifeless they really are.\\n\\nX. If you're smart, you'll think about who's really handing out props and what dying actually means. Strip death of all the drama, and it's just nature doing its thing. Being scared of nature's work is kid stuff. Death? It's natural and even helpful.\\n\\nXI. Consider how we connect with the divine, and how that divine bit in us feels when it's spread out. Nothing's more pitiful than a soul lost, roaming everything, looking for something it can't even name.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"j6tXuEVXKBOm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
