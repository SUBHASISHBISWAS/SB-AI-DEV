I mean they obviously want to make more money from Xbox, but like, gaming is just a tad under 50% of Sony's revenue, whereas it's like 10% of Microsoft's revenue. Microsoft has far greater ambitions. Plus as others have pointed out, the Xbox really is just a segue device into getting a proper PC, or a PC-lite way of gaming for Microsoft's ecosystem. Sony has no equivalent whatsoever.\n",

I I was an Xbox guy since the 360 came out but once the exclusives like forza made their way over to PC I had no reason to get an xbox anymore.

      "I‚Äôm confused about the bull case for 2025.  Where does the extra production come from?  Fremont is at its physical limits.  Even if they double Austin and Berlin, how do you get to 4.8m without another factory?  IIRC it took about 2.5 years for Shangahai, Berlin and Austin to go from announced to making cars so any factory that is going to be making significant volume in 2025 needs to get started like yesterday.\n",
      "I think your bear case is my most bullish case. I don't think they'll nearly double their sales by 2024, but even if they do and sell every car they produce, they are going to have a lot of trouble sustaining their margins when are already struggling at current levels of production. They are largely driven by hype, and Elon has done a great job blowing that up. Does TSLA have any products or technology that justify its valuation as a tech company? any competitive advantages? Their methods/sensors for FSD are inherently worse than what other auto makers are doing, and everything I see and hear is that their build quality is subpar. I expect they'll see a lot more competition very soon, and being valued more than all other auto makers combined =/= undervalued\n",
