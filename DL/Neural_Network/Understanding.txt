My Understanding :
1. So weighted Sum to Perceptron or neuron or node is nothing but Matrix multiplication



Important Author Note:

The truth of the feed-forward algorithm is the inputs come in you take a
weighted sum you add in the bias and pass it through the activation function and
that result feeds forward towards the network and go straight to the output.

And guess what the output does the output takes  the weights of all the connections
between the hidden and the output so the matrix product of the hiddens with
those weights plus its own biases then passes that through the sigmoid function.

This just happens every sing with every single layer here come the inputs
weighted sum passes the activation function send that as output into the
weighted sum of the next node pass of the activation function send output.
